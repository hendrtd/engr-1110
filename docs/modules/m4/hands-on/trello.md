# Getting Started with Trello

Trello is a web-based tool that supports work management via
[Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) boards. Trello is owned by
[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/), a company that develops products for
software development and project management. You and your team will use Trello
to manage the work required for the team project in this course.

This activity is designed to introduce you to Trello and to get you started
using it in the Team Lab Assignment.

# Cultural Intelligence Post-Survey

Now that we're at the end of the course, we'd like to get an idea of everyone's
current thoughts and ideas with respect to cultural issues. Please take your
time and provide thoughtful and considered answers to each question.

Your answers will be completely confidential, so please select the answer that
**best** describes you **as you really are**. There is no "right" or "wrong"
answer but rather the best answer is the one that describes how you really are.

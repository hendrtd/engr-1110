# Reflecting on the Module

This final module of the course gave you a chance to show off your work and
tell us how you did it. All the work is complete, so it's time to reflect on
the entire course.

- What did you learn?
- How might this help you in upcoming courses?
- What are you still unsure about, and what questions do you have?
- Is there any work that you left undone? Is there an opportunity to avoid this in furture courses?
- Are you satisfied with the way in which you completed this course, and with the way you managed your time?
- How might you improve your workflow and study habits for future courses?

Taking time to 
[reflect on your
experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice), rather than
just moving on, can be an important part of learning and getting better - not
just in school, but on the job and in life.

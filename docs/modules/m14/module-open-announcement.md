# Module 14 Announcements

Welcome to the last week of the course! I hope you've found it to be a
rewarding experience, and have hopefully enjoyed it as well! This module is
where you get to tell (and show!) us what you've been working on for the past
six weeks. The work is done, and all that remains is to present your efforts
and the product. 

Your TA will send a separate announcement with when you are scheduled to
present, but each of the following class periods this week will be used for
presentations.

- Monday, 8:00 AM - 8:50 AM (no lecture)
- Monday, 9:00 AM - 9:50 AM 
- Wednesday, 9:00 AM - 9:50 AM 
- Friday, 9:00 AM - 9:50 AM (if needed)

Good luck, and have fun in this final module!

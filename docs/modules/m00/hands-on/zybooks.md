# Getting Started With zyBooks

This course uses a custom zyBook from the *zyBooks* Wiley Brand as a required
course resource. Payment for zyBook access is handled via the AU All Access
program, and there is a Canvas announcement with further details about payment
via your eBill. **Do _not_ pay for access to zyBooks via the zyBooks website
using any personal payment method.** Payment is only via your AU eBill.

To access and subscribe to the zyBook, you only need to do the following.

1. Navigate to the first zyBook assignment, which is later in this module.

1. Click on the "load in a new window" button at the bottom of this page. *This
   will open the course zyBook in the context of the assignment and will automatically link your Canvas account to your zyBook account.*

1. Complete the assignment and your score will be automatically posted to
   Canvas.

If you do not opt out of the All Access program by the given deadline, you will
automatically be charged for the zyBook access on your next eBill. If you opt
out you will lose access and you will have to make payment on your own to
continue access.

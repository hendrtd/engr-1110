# Cultural Intelligence Pre-Survey

Before we discuss cultural issues and consider what contributes to *cultural
intelligence*, we'd like to get an idea of everyone's thoughts and ideas at the
start. Please take your time and provide thoughtful and considered answers to
each question.

Your answers will be completely confidential, so please select the answer that
**best** describes you **as you really are**. There is no "right" or "wrong"
answer but rather the best answer is the one that describes how you really are.

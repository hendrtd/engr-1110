# Get To Know Your Team

Each student has been assigned to a project team of 4 to 5 students. You can see
what team your own and who the other team members are by going to *People* in
the left Canvas menu and then selecting the *Project Teams* tab. Below is a link
to the Canvas tutorial on Groups:

Be sure to send the members of your team a message to introduce yourself, and
plan to work together during this module's labs sessions. Your lab TA will help
you sit with your team once you arrive in lab.

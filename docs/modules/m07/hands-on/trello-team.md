# Using Trello as a Team

Now that you've used Trello yourself for individual work, this activity is
designed to help you use Trello in a team environment. **All members of the team
should be present and work through the first several step together, with each
member logged into their Trello account.**

1. Load [Trello](http://trello.com) in a web browser and log in.

1. Create a new board and name it "Team Lab: zyBook Chapter 10 Labs".

1. Click the Share button in the top right of the Trello window and add each
   member of the team to the Board.

1. Create three lists named "Backlog", "In Progress", and "Done".

1. In the Backlog list, add a card for each lab below from zyBook Chapter 10.

   - 10.8 LAB: Words in a range (lists)
   - 10.9 LAB: Word frequencies (lists)
   - 10.10 LAB: Sorting TV Shows (dictionaries and lists)
   - 10.11 LAB: Course Grade
   - 10.11 LAB: Thesaurus

1. Add exactly one member to each card. This assigns the **responsibility** of
   completing that particular lab to the given team member. (*Note: If your team
   has only 4 members, you can pick the Chapter 10 lab that you leave undone.
   Your team grade will be updated so that your score is not penalized.*)

1. Each team member should customize their card with due dates, checklists, and
   other features to help plan and document their work. 

1. Each team member must work independently to meet the responsibility of
   completing their assigned lab. Other team members can provide help,
   suggestions, and guidance, but the team member assigned to the card must
   complete the work.

1. Each team member must move their assigned card through the three lists
   (Backlog, In Progress, and Done) to document their work.

1. Before the due date, **one member** of the team must click the Share button,
   select "Copy link", and then record this link as the required submission in
   Canvas.
 
**NOTES ON GRADING:**
- Each member of the team will be assigned the **same grade** for this
  assignment.
- The team grade will be composed of the scores earned by each individual member
  of the team.
- The grade for each lab will be the score recorded in zyBooks for the team
  member assigned to that lab.
- The grade for using Trello will be based on how each team member documented
  their work appropriately in Trello.

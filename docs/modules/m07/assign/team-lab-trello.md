# Using Trello as a Team

Now that you've used Trello yourself for individual work, this assignment is
designed to help you use Trello in a team environment. **All members of the
team should be present and work through the first several step together, with
each member logged into their Trello account.**

1. Load [Trello](http://trello.com) in a web browser and log in.

1. Create a new board and name it "Team Lab: Module 7".

1. Click the Share button in the top right of the Trello window and add each
   member of the team to the Board.

1. Create three lists named "Backlog", "In Progress", and "Done".

1. In the Backlog list, add a card for each lab below from zyBook Chapter 9.

    - 9.16 LAB: Varied amount of input data
    - 9.17 LAB: Filter and sort a list 
    - 9.18 LAB: Contact list 
    - 9.19 LAB: Car wash

1. In the Backlog list, add a card for each lab below from zyBook Chapter 10.

    - 10.8 LAB: Guess the random number
    - 10.9 LAB: Quadratic forumula
    - 10.10 LAB: Dates 
    - 10.11 LAB: Radioactive decay 

1. Add exactly one member to each card from Chapter 9, and then add exactly one
   member to each card from Chapter 10. This assigns the **responsibility** of
completing two labs (one from Chapter 9 and one from Chapter 10) to each team
member.

1. Each team member should customize their card with due dates, checklists, and
   other features to help plan and document their work. 

1. Each team member must work independently to meet the responsibility of
   completing their assigned lab. Other team members can provide help,
   suggestions, and guidance, but the team member assigned to the card must
   complete the work.

1. Each team member must move their assigned card through the three lists
   (Backlog, In Progress, and Done) to document their work.

1. Before the due date, **each member** of the team must click the Share button,
   select "Copy link", and then record this link as their required submission in
   Canvas.
 
**NOTES ON GRADING:** Each member of the team will be assigned an individual
grade based on their individual work documented in zyBooks and Trello.

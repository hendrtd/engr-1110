# Module 10 Announcements

Here are a few things to keep in mind as you begin this module.

- Time management, as always, will be important. Be sure to set aside time each
day to work on this course, and **donâ€™t try to get everything done in the one
or two days before things are due.**

- Although the module is laid out sequentially, it might be best to work
through everything iteratively instead. That is, interleave working on all the
concepts presented in this module, just as described in the
[workflow](../m00/structure.md) suggested in Module 0. But however you decide
to go through the material, be sure to work on the course each day, pace
yourself, and prepare to have all graded work completed by the end of the
module.

- You will be working with your team in **Sprint 1** - the first of four Scrum
development sprints in which you actively develop your project deliverables.   

- You will also be taking part in **active discussions** within your team and
with the entire class regarding your thoughts and readings in **cultural
intelligence**.

- An [active](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning),
  [self-regulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-regulated_learning)
  approach to learning in this course is crucial to your success. The passive
  activities we typically associate with "studying" (attendance, reading,
  listening, watching) are necessary, but they are not sufficient. Actively
  practicing and **doing** are vitally important to mastering the course
  content.

- Be sure to ask any questions that you have. The most efficient way to get
  general questions answered is by posting to the course forum.

Good luck, and have fun in the module!

# Getting Started with Google Colaboratory

This activity will introduce you to Google's Colaboratory (Colab) software, a
cloud-based interactive computing environment similar to [Jupyter
Notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter). Colab is free but
does require a Google Account.

The following steps are to be completed by each student individually.

## Colab Overview

1. If you do not have a Google account already, create one at the following
   link.

1. Become familiar with Colab's structure and capabilities by watching the
   following video:

## Create Your Own Colab Notebook

Let's create a Colab notebook to produce the following plot, as shown in section
11.3 of the course zyBook.

1. In the Colab *File* menu, click *New notebook*.

1. The notebook will have a default "untitled" name. Change the name to
   something meaningful.

1. Click the *+Text* button to add a text cell to the notebook.

1. Click the up-arrow button to the right to move the text cell above the
   existing code cell that was already in the notebook.

1. Double-click the text cell and enter the following:
```
# Alcohol Fatalities 1970 - 2012

This notebook will compare the trend in total highway fatalities to those
involving alcohol from 1970 through 2012.

# Getting Started With zyBooks

This course uses a custom zyBook from the *zyBooks* Wiley Brand as a required
course resource. Payment for zyBook access is handled via the AU All Access
program, and there is a Canvas announcement with further details about payment
via your ebill.

**DO NOT purchase access directly from zyBooks.**

To access and subscribe to the zyBook:

1. Click on the "load in a new window" button at the bottom of this page.  *This
   will open the course zyBook in the context of an assignment.*
1. Provide the AU All Access access code (received via email from
   `noreply@auburn.edu`) to subscribe to the zyBook. Do not provide any credit
   card information. Only provide the access code.

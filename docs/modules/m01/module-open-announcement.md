# Module 1 Announcements

As you begin Module 1, here are a few things to keep in mind.

- Time management, as always, will be important. Be sure to set aside time each
  day to work on this course, and donâ€™t try to get everything done in the one or
  two days before things are due.

- Although the module is laid out sequentially, it might be best to work through
  everything iteratively instead. That is, interleave working on the zyBook
  Activities, the zyBook Lab, and the cultural intelligence readings and
  responses, much like the [workflow](../m0/structure.md) suggested in Module 0.
  But however you decide to go through the material, be sure to work on the
  course each day, pace yourself, and prepare to have all graded work completed
  by the end of the module.

- An [active](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning),
  [self-regulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-regulated_learning)
  approach to learning in this course is crucial to your success. The passive
  activities we typically associate with "studying" (attendance, reading,
  listening, watching) are necessary, but they are not sufficient. Actively
  practicing and **doing** are vitally important to mastering the course
  content.

- As in each module, all graded work items are due by the last Friday of the
  module. You may submit on the last Saturday of the module for a 25% penalty,
  and on the last Sunday of the module for a 50% penalty. No work will be
  accepted after the last Sunday of the module.

- Be sure to ask any questions that you have. The most efficient way to get
  general questions answered is by posting to the course forum.

Good luck, and have fun in the module!

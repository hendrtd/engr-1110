# Reflecting on the Module

This module provided a high-level overview of data science and how Python is
used in that context. The module also introduced the idea of **cultural
intelligence** and its importance in the context of engineering. Finally, the
module included a period of project planning in which you planned out the
coming four development sprints for your project.

Take time now to review and reflect on this module and the work you've done.

- What did you learn?
- How might this help you in upcoming modules?
- What are you still unsure about, and what questions do you have?
- Is there any work that you left undone? Is there still time to complete it?
- Are you satisfied with the way in which you completed this module, and with the way you managed your time?
- How might you improve your workflow and study habits for the next module?

Taking time to 
[reflect on your
experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice), rather than
just moving on, can be an important part of learning and getting better - not
just in school, but on the job and in life.

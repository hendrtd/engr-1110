# Python Fundamentals - Functions; Engineering Design, Scrum, and Trello

This module continues to introduce fundamental concepts in programming, and
focuses on **functions** - a language feature that allows us to encapsulate a
set of statements into one unit and then *call* or *invoke* the function to
have those statements executed from any point in our program and as many times
as needed. Functions are a fundamental way of organizing our code into
meaningful and related components.

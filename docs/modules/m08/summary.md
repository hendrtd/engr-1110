# Reflecting on the Module

This module has continued the development of programming concepts with a focus
on files and plotting in Python, and introduced the Google Colab service for
Jupyter Notebooks as a means of publishing data analysis solutions in Python.
This module has also continued to emphasize using the Scrum framework to get
work done as a team, and utilizing Trello to plan and document your development
work.

# Team zyBook Lab

This assignment requires that you use Trello to plan, manage, and document your
work as a team to complete Python labs in zyBooks. **All members of the team
should be present and work through the first several step together, with each
member logged into their Trello account.**

1. Load [Trello](http://trello.com) in a web browser and log in.

1. Create a new board and name it "Team Lab: Module 8".

1. Click the Share button in the top right of the Trello window and add each
   member of the team to the Board.

1. Create three lists named "Backlog", "In Progress", and "Done".

1. In the Backlog list, add a card for **any four** of the six labs from zyBook Chapter 11.

1. In the Backlog list, add a card for **any four** of the six labs from zyBook Chapter 12.

1. Add exactly one member to each card from Chapter 11, and then add exactly
   one member to each card from Chapter 12. This assigns the **responsibility**
of completing two labs (one from Chapter 11 and one from Chapter 12) to each
team member.

1. Each team member should customize their card with due dates, checklists, and
   other features to help plan and document their work. 

1. Each team member must work independently to meet the responsibility of
   completing their assigned lab. Other team members can provide help,
   suggestions, and guidance, but the team member assigned to the card must
   complete the work.

1. Each team member must move their assigned card through the three lists
   (Backlog, In Progress, and Done) to document their work.

1. Before the due date, **each member** of the team must click the Share button,
   select "Copy link", and then record this link as their required submission in
   Canvas.
 
**NOTES ON GRADING:** 

- Each member of the team will be assigned an individual grade based on their
individual work documented in zyBooks and Trello.

- Do not make a submission in Canvas until you are finished and ready for your
work to be graded. No work submitted once grading begins will be considered.

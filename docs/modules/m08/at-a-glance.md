# Succeeding in This Module

To be successful in this module you will want to practice good time management
and adopt an iterative approach to completing the material. The
[workflow](../m0/structure.md) suggested in Module 0 offers a good start at
coming up with your own personal approach to getting work done. 

Each module in this course builds upon previous concepts and so it is important
that you master each module as we progress through the course.  Be proactive and
begin your work early in the module to allow the material to sink in. If you
don't understand something or have a question, it is crucial that you reach out
for help sooner rather than later. Ask questions, engage with the class, and be
proactive. These are good strategies for success.

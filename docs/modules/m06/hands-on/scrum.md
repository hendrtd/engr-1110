# Scrum - A Framework for Getting Work Done as a Team

Scrum a popular framework used by engineering teams to get work done
effectively, efficiently, and with minimal overhead. Scrum is particularly
popular with software engineering teams, and is considered one of the exemplar
approaches of [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
development. You will quickly recognize the values expressed in the [Agile
Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/) in the
core principles of Scrum.

The overall workflow and elements of Scrum are depicted in the image below. More
information can be found at
[Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/learning-series/what-is-scrum), and the
official and most detailed information on Scrum is available in the [Scrum
Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).

We will be following the basic principles and practices of Scrum to do the work
required of your team project, but we won't be doing a deep dive into the
details of the framework. We will use just enough Scrum to help us in this
class, and your familiarity with the basic ideas will be helpful in later
courses and when you interview for internships.

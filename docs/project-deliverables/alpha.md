# Project Alpha Release 

The project **alpha release** corresponds to an important part of the [software
release life cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle) -
a pre-release version of the software that demonstrates some but not all of the
planned or required feature set. 

The exact feature set implemented in the alpha release will naturally vary from
team to team according to the specific nature of the project chosen. And
particularly for this course, the manner in which the team has been functioning
and the manner in which the alpha release was developed is just as important as
what has been developed, and thus the team scrum board (Trello) is also
evaluated as part of this project milestone.

Your team's alpha release and scrum board will be evaluated according the rubric
below (to be published).

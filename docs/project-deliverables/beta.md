# Project Alpha Release 

The project **beta release** corresponds to an important part of the [software
release life cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle) -
a **feature complete** version of the software that implements all the required
functionality but is not yet a **release candidate** due to bugs, performance
issues, or other sources of instability.

The beta release should reflect a full implementation of the project concept,
and should be clearly developed according to the Scrum framework. For this
course, the manner in which the team has been functioning and the manner in
which the beta release was developed is just as important as what has been
developed, and thus the team scrum board (Trello) is also evaluated as part of
this project milestone.

Your team's beta release and scrum board will be evaluated according the rubric
below (to be published).

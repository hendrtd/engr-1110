# Project Concept

The Project Concept is the culmination and deliverable of initial project
planning. In the context of the Scrum framework being used for the project, the
Project Concept consists of:

- The name and brief bio-sketch of each team member, along with their role(s) in
  the team (Developer, Product Owner, Scrum Master).

- The Product Vision

- The Product Goal(s)

- An initial Product Backlog

For your team's Project Concept, upload a single document that contains all the
information listed above.

**Each team member must upload the same Project Concept document.**

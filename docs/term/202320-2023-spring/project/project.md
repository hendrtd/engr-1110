# ENGR 1110 Project Description

## Overview

A team project is an integral part of ENGR 1110 and it is designed to enable
each member of the team to:

- apply Python programming skills 
- learn to work within the context of an authentic software process like one
  used in industry
- develop teamwork skills
- develop written and oral communication skills
- develop the ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using
  appropriate learning strategies
- learn presentation skills and the use of organizational tools

The theme for this semester's project is *Visualizing Global Issues*. Working in
a team of four to six students, you are required to propose, design, implement,
and deliver a data visualization and analytics project to address real-world
problems. The visualizations may be embedded within a UI or within reports and
presentations. 

In real-world applications, data visualization is an important precursor to
higher level data analysis, often using machine learning or deep learning
techniques, for example, as applied in data science. You are not asked or
required to perform any of this higher level data analysis, only the data
visualization.

The project must address a real-world problem such as:

- Natural disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, etc.)
- Extreme weather (severe cold, heat waves, atmospheric rivers, droughts, etc.)
- Pollution (poor air quality, contaminated water supply, etc.)
- Public health (disease, pandemics, epidemics, vaccination, etc.)
- Economics (poverty, inflation, recession, etc.)
- Politics and Government (war, armed conflict, voting, etc.)

The following are **examples** of specific project themes that you could choose
within the above categories. These are only examples, not requirements.

**Air Pollution in India** - Visualizations in this category must tell a story
to the Government of India about air pollution in their cities. The union
government launched a National Clear Air Program to reduce particulate matter
pollution ([https://ncaptracker.in/ncap/](https://ncaptracker.in/ncap/))).

**Poverty in Brazil** - Visualizations in this category must tell a story to the
Government of Brazil about poverty in their communities. The government launched
welfare payments in 2021 through the Auxilo Brasil program
([https://borgenproject.org/tag/the-auxilio-brasil-program/](https://borgenproject.org/tag/the-auxilio-brasil-program/)). 

**Earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria** - Visualizations in this category must tell
a story related to disaster management with respect to the recent earthquakes
that have affected these two countries. For example, you could focus on rescue
assistance, building structural integrity, providing humanitarian aid, or rescue
efforts. Here is an example resource for Türkiye:

Remember: These are just examples, and your team is free to propose any
reasonable project focus that falls within the overall theme for the semester of 
*Visualizing Global Issues*.

Here are a few freely accessible datasets that you may find useful.

team must be properly attributed and comply with all copyright laws.


## Project Scope and Requirements

Your project must meet the following minimum requirements:

- Use Python 3 and an appropriate package such as Matplotlib, NumPy, or Pandas.
- Use a real-world dataset.
- Allow interactive input and interaction from the user.
- Visualize data in a meaningful way (identify patterns/trends, provide
  interactive visuals).

Your project must contain narrative elements that:

- Define the global issue being addressed.
- Describe the data collection process.
- Describe the process of data exploration and building the visualization.
- Provide the message / story that is being communicated through the
  visualizations.

Beyond these basic requirements we want you to exercise your creativity - choose
something that excites you! Impress us!

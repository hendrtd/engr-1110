# Welcome to ENGR 1110 Spring 2023!

This course provides an introduction to engineering design, engineering teams,
technical writing, oral presentation, and cultural intelligence. The Software
Engineering sections do this specifically in the context of software
development. It's a very hands-on (and fun!) course, and we're looking forward
to the semester.

I am out of town on University business Wednesday, January 11 through Friday,
January 13, so ENGR 1110 will not meet in lecture or lab the first week of
classes. And to ensure that we all meet together for lecture before labs start,
the **first lecture will be on Friday, January 20** from 10:00 AM CT - 10:50 AM
CT in Shelby 1103, and **the first lab meeting will be on Tuesday, January 24.**

The Canvas course for ENGR 1110 will be published and available no later than
Monday, January 16.

See you on Friday, January 20, and War Eagle!

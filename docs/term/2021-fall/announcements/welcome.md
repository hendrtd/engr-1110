# Welcome to ENGR 1110 Fall 2021!

This course provides an introduction to engineering design, engineering teams,
technical writing, oral presentation, and engineering ethics. The Software
Engineering sections do this specifically in the context of software
development. It's a very hands-on (and fun!) course, and we're looking forward
to the semester.

The first lecture will be on Friday, August 20 from 12:00 PM - 12:50 PM CT in
Lowder 125A. Labs will not meet the first week but will instead begin on Tuesday,
August 24. Please refer to the course syllabus for details on instructional
modality, course policies, grading and more.

See you on Friday, and War Eagle!

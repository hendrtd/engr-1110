# Project Release Beta

The project beta release corresponds to an important part of the [software
release life cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle) -
a pre-release version of the software than demonstrates some but not all of the
planned or required feature set. The exact feature set implemented will of
course vary from team to team according to the specific nature of the project
chosen. And particularly for this course, the manner in which the team has been
functioning and the manner in which the beta release was developed is just as
important as what has been developed, and thus the team scrum board is also
evaluated as part of this project milestone.

Your team's beta release and scrum board will be evaluated according the rubric
below (to be published).

# Welcome to ENGR 1110 Fall 2023!

This course provides an introduction to engineering design, engineering teams,
technical writing, oral presentation, and cultural intelligence. The Software
Engineering sections do this specifically in the context of software
development. It's a very hands-on (and fun!) course, and I'm looking forward to
the semester.

See you on Monday, August 21, and War Eagle!

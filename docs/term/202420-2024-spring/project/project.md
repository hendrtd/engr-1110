# ENGR 1110 Project Description

## Overview

A team project is an integral part of ENGR 1110 and it is designed to enable
each member of the team to:

- apply Python programming skills
- apply spreadsheet skills
- learn to work with Google Colab notebooks
- learn to work within the context of an authentic software process similar to
  one used in industry
- develop teamwork skills
- develop written and oral communication skills
- develop the ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using
  appropriate learning strategies
- learn presentation skills and the use of organizational tools

The theme for this semester's project is **Data Driven Exploration of Global
Issues**. Working in a team of four to six students, you are required to
propose, design, implement, and deliver a data visualization and analytics
project to characterize and describe a real-world problem. Your team's project
must be built from different components developed by individual team members
and then assembled into a single Google Colab notebook that integrates prose,
Python code, and data visualizations into a cohesive whole. 

Here are two example Google Colab Notebooks, just to illustrate how a Colab
notebook is a powerful and effective means of combining discussion, analysis,
data, and computation. Neither are intended as an example that you must
emulate.

- [Collapse of SVB (Silicon Valley Bank)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15uxrAeCCL327kWH9N0X-ogKwf2zErjP5)
- [Exploratory Data Analysis in Python](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Exploratory_data_Analysis.ipynb) 


Your team's project must address a real-world, global-scale problem such as:

- **Poverty** - Analyze data on poverty rates, income inequality, and access to
  basic necessities to understand the challenges faced by different populations.
  Here is an example resource focused on Brazil:

- **Climate Change** - Use data on temperature, carbon emissions, and sea-level
  rise to visualize the impact of climate change on different regions of the
  world. Here is an example resource for Pakistan:
  [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/pakistan-temperature](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/pakistan-temperature)

- **Healthcare** - Explore data on healthcare expenditure, disease prevalence,
  and access to medical facilities to identify areas that may need intervention.
  Here is an example resource for Haiti:
  [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/haiti-health-facilities-locations](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/haiti-health-facilities-locations)

These are just examples, and your team is free to propose any reasonable
project that falls within the overall theme for the semester.

Here are a few freely accessible datasets that you may find useful.

- Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- data.world: [https://data.world/product/community/](https://data.world/product/community/)
- Data.gov: [https://data.gov/](https://data.gov/)
- FiveThirtyEight: [https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)

team must be properly attributed and comply with all copyright laws.


## Useful Python Libraries

- **Data Visualization**: The `matplotlib` library provides powerful tools for
  visualizing data. By creating various types of charts such as line plots, bar
  graphs, scatter plots, and heatmaps, we can more effectively convey the
  information present in a dataset. Visualizations can help in identifying
  trends, patterns, and outliers, thereby enabling a deeper understanding of the
  issues characterized by the data. See Chapter 11 of the course zyBook for
  information on using `matplotlib`.

- **Trend Analysis and Statistics**: The `numpy` library offers a range of
  functionalities that can be used to identify trends, patterns and statistics,
  within the datasets.  By applying statistical methods such as mean, median,
  standard, deviation, and correlation, we can gain insights into the
  relationships between different variables.  Trend analysis and statistics
  provide valuable information to support decision-making and propose actionable
  steps to make a difference. See Chapter 11 of the course zyBook for
  information on using `numpy`.


## Project Scope and Requirements

Your project must meet the following minimum requirements:

- Use Python 3 and an appropriate package such as Matplotlib, NumPy, or Pandas.
- Incorporate the use of a spreadsheet in a meaningful way.
- Use a real-world dataset.
- Create visualizations and analysis from Python code.
- Visualize data in a meaningful way (identify patterns/trends, provide
  interactive visuals).

Your project must contain narrative elements that:

- Define the global issue being addressed.
- Describe the data collection process.
- Describe the process of data exploration and building the visualization.
- Provide the message / story that is being communicated through the
  visualizations.
- Identify actions that could be taken to address the identified issue. This may
  involve raising awareness, advocating for policy changes, supporting
  organizations working in the area, or developing innovative solutions.

Beyond these basic requirements we want you to exercise your creativity - choose
something that excites you! Impress us!

# Project Examples

Below are a few project examples from previous semesters. **These are just for
illustration and they may not conform to all the requirements listed above for
this semester.** Even so, these examples allow you to see elements of a course
project from the team's perspective.

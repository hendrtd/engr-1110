# Welcome to ENGR 1110 Spring 2024!

Happy New Year to everyone, and I hope you had a great holiday break! ENGR 1110
is a fun course, and I'm truly looking forward to this semester. 

The course doesn't meet the first week of classes and the first Monday of the
semester is a holiday, so the first class meeting will be **Wednesday, January
17 in lab**. There will be things to do and some work to complete in Canvas
starting January 10, but we won't meet together until January 17.

This course provides an introduction to engineering design, teamwork, beginning
programming, working with data, developing cultural intelligence, and other
concepts, all in the context of computer science and software engineering. That
sounds like a lot! But it's all done at a truly introductory level to prepare
you for a deeper dive into these topics later in your curriculum.

ENGR 1110 is a combined lecture/lab course that meets for 50 minutes each week
in lecture and for 150 minutes each week in lab. Lecture meets from 8:00 AM -
8:50 AM Mondays in Shelby 1103, and labs meet from 9:00 AM - 9:50 AM MWF in the
Shelby computer lab assigned to your particular course section. There are 2
sections of the course, and they meet together for lecture and (this semester)
also together for lab. There will be a separate Canvas announcement about lab
meetings.

Remember: You'll have work to do in Canvas beginning January 10, but we won't
meet together as a class until the labs on Wednesday, January 17.

See you soon, and War Eagle!

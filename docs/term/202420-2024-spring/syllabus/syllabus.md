All course sections meet together for lecture but separately for lab.

- *Lecture meetings*: Course staff will conduct in-person lectures and all
  students are required to attend. Attendance will be recorded and will directly
  affect your grade.

- *Lab meetings*: Course staff will conduct in-person labs and all students are
  required to attend. Attendance will be recorded and will directly affect your
  grade.

- *Office Hours*: Course staff will hold office hours via Zoom at a set time
  from the second week of classes through the last day of classes. No office
  hours will be held during finals week. The specific day/time for office hours
  will be announced during the first week of classes. In-person office hours are
  available if needed, but only by appointment.

# Grading

Your grade for the course will be determined by the points you earn on items in
the following categories.

- **Programming Activities** (20%): Participation Activities and Challenge Activities will
  be assigned from selected chapters of the course zyBook.

- **Programming Labs** (30%): zyLabs will be assigned from selected chapters of the course
  zyBook.
  
- **Team Project** (30%): A software development project will be assigned and must be
  completed in teams.

- **Cultural Agility** (10%): Graded work focused on developing cultural
  competency in a professional context.

- **Attendance and Engagement** (10%): Attendance is required in lecture and lab,
  and full engagement is encouraged.

Your total score (*Total*) for the course will be calculated as follows, where
*PA* is the percentage of possible points earned on Programming Activities, *PL*
is the percentage of possible points earned on Programming Labs, *TP* is the
percentage of possible points earned on the Team Project, *CA* is the percentage
of possible points earned on Cultural Agility, and *AE* is the percentage of
possible points earned on Attendance and Engagement. Each percentage is
calculated as (*points earned* / *points possible*) * 100.


*Total* = (0.20 * *PA*) + (0.30 * *PL*) + (0.30 * *TP*) + (0.10 * *CA*) + (0.10 * *AE*) 

Your letter grade for the course will be assigned based on your *Total* numeric
score using the following scale.

*Total*   | Letter Grade
--------  | ------------
[90, 100] | A
[80, 90)  | B
[70, 80)  | C
[60, 70)  | D
[0, 60)   | F

**Extra Credit:** Opportunities for extra credit are sometimes given to the
entire class, but are never given on an individual basis. Extra credit
opportunities are often given during class meetings and you must be present to
earn points.

# Course Policies


## Attendance

The [AU Policy on Class
Attendance](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/Policies/PolicyonClassAttendance.pdf)
is strictly observed in this course. Refer to the Instructional Mode section of
this syllabus for a description of all course elements that require attendance.
Absences are considered unexcused unless the student specifically obtains an
excused absence from the instructor (see policy below).

Note that *attendance* is only one part of *engagement*. You are expected to
fully engage in this course and take responsibility for your learning
experience. Lack of engagement almost always leads to poor course performance.


## Excused Absences

To have an absence excused you must first obtain an Excused Absence Memo from
Engineering Student Services (ESS) for any absence that falls into categories 1
through 6 in the AU Policy on Class Attendance. You should contact the course
instructor directly for other absences.

> Engineering Student Services provides excused absence memos to students who
> present verifiable documentation related to university excused absences.  The
> steps for obtaining an excused absence memo are as follows:
>
> 1. The student submits the request form using this link:
>    [https://aub.ie/EngAbsence](https://aub.ie/EngAbsence)
>    - Students submit documentation of the reason for the absence.
>    - Students must read and acknowledge the excused absence policy.
>
> 1. The ESS office staff processes the requests and verifies authenticity of
>    documentation provided by student, as well as the dates of the absence(s).
>
> 1. Assistant Dean determines if the documentation meets the standard for a
>    university excused absence or if the documentation warrants consideration
>    by the professor.
>
> 1. An official memo is sent directly to professors via email regarding the
>    student’s absence


## Late Submission or Makeup for Graded Items

All graded items are due no later than the date and time specified in Canvas.
Late submissions or makeup opportunities are only available for **excused
absences** (see policy). 


## Time Commitment

Auburn University has the following
[expectation](http://www.auburn.edu/student_info/student_policies/) of the time
commitment and work that a course will require per credit hour. "*Auburn
University expects that for each credit hour awarded, an appropriately prepared
student will complete an average of 3-3.5 hours of academic work per week over
the length of a 15 week semester.*" This time estimate is independent of
instructional mode. 

This course carries 2 credit hours, so at a minimum, an "appropriately
prepared" student would be expected to spend approximately 8 hours each week
working on this course. Regardless of the specifics, you are expected to
allocate an appropriate amount of time for this course. 


## Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is critical to the entire educational process and is a serious
matter in this course. Issues surrounding violations of academic honesty will be
handled per the [Student Academic Honesty
Code](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/policies/academichonestycode.pdf).
You are encouraged to familiarize yourself with this policy and the other
resources available from the [Office of Academic
Effectiveness](http://www.auburn.edu/academic/provost/academic-effectiveness/academic-honesty.php).

What constitutes cheating on exams and tests is fairly obvious, and everyone
understands that anything other than individual work on these is wrong. Where
many students are unsure of what is allowable and what is not allowable is in
the completion of programming assignments. I encourage students to form study
groups, help each other learn the course material, and help each other solve
problems. Collaborative problem solving is a great way to learn. However,
collaborative problem solving must be restricted to the level of concepts,
strategies, and algorithms; it should never involve source code. If you're in
doubt about a certain practice, it's best to ask rather than assume it's okay.
In certain instances, course work may be completed in groups rather than
individually, but these instances will be clearly identified by the instructor
and the collaboration is allowed only within the bounds set by the instructor.


## Communication with Instructor and Teaching Assistants

Your Auburn University email address (`@auburn.edu`) is the university-approved
form of communication between instructors and students. Emails that you send to
the instructor or to a teaching assistant must come from your `@auburn.edu`
email address. Sending emails from addresses other than `@auburn.edu` could
result in you not receiving a response to your message. Do not send messages via
Canvas; instead, send an email.

All course announcements will be posted to Canvas and/or sent to your
`@auburn.edu` address. All email communications from the instructor to you will
be sent to your `@auburn.edu` address. Follow the steps in the video linked
[here](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Video-Guide/Notification-Preferences-All-Users/ta-p/383690)
to set your notifications preferences and specify that all course alerts are
routed to your `@auburn.edu` email address. You are expected to check both
Canvas and your `@auburn.edu` account daily. 


## Getting Help in the Course

If you find yourself struggling academically in this course, please reach out to
your instructor and/or a teaching assistant as soon as possible. Do not wait
until the end of the term to seek help for problems that were present weeks
earlier. The instructor and teaching assistants want to help you, but can not do
so unless you ask in a timely manner.


## Accessibility

Students who need accommodations are asked to electronically submit their
approved accommodations through AU Access and to arrange a meeting with me
during the first week of classes, or as soon as possible if accommodations are
immediately needed. If you need accommodations but have not established them,
make an appointment with the Office of Accessibility, 1228 Haley Center,
334-844-2096.


## Diversity and Inclusion Statement

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be
well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in
and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be
viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present
materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, religion,
sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, veteran status, ethnicity,
race, and culture. All students in this course are expected to respect their
fellow classmates and actively participate in fostering an inclusive learning
environment. If you experience anything in this class that makes you feel
uncomfortable, please bring it to my attention and we will formulate a response.
If you would prefer to remain anonymous you may complete a [Bias Incident
Report](http://studentaffairs.auburn.edu/bert/submit-a-report-of-bias/) which
will maintain your confidentiality.

Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students
or student groups.


## Classroom Behavior

The Auburn University [Policy on Classroom
Behavior](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/Policies/PolicyonClassroomBehavior.pdf)
is strictly followed in this course. Note that this policy extends to all online
elements of this course.


## Grade Appeals

Scores for all graded items will be posted to Canvas. You will have five
business days from the date that a score is posted to Canvas to send an email to
the instructor requesting grade adjustments on your work. If no appeal is sent
to the instructor after five business days, the score is final. Once the
five-day appeal period has passed, students forfeit their right to have the
graded material reassessed at a later date.

To appeal a grade that you have received, send an email to the instructor
specifying the graded item in question and justifying in a clear, concise manner
why you think your response should be awarded more points. Once received, the
instructor may or may not communicate with you regarding your appeal.
Ultimately, the instructor will render a decision. 


## Extended Student Absence

If illness or other unforeseen cirumstance causes you to be unable to
participate in the course, please contact me as soon as possible to discuss your
options.


## Extended Instructor Absence

If illness or other unforeseen circumstance causes me to be unable to continue
teaching the course, a back-up instructor has been selected who will assume all
teaching responsibilities to ensure that the course will proceed uninterrupted.


## Auburn University Transition to Remote Operations

If Auburn University is forced to move to remote operations, the instructional
modality for this course will be Online Synchronous. No changes to course
content or schedule would be anticipated, but all such details will be announced
via Canvas and updated in this syllabus as appropriate. You should personally
plan now for this contingency to ensure that you will be able to minimize the
disruption this move could cause to your personal living and study arrangements.


## Data Collection and Use Disclosure

Any and all results of graded items in the course are data sources for research
and assessment, and may be used in publications related to research and
accreditation. All such use will be anonymous.

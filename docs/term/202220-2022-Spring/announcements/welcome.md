# Welcome to ENGR 1110 Spring 2022!

This course provides an introduction to engineering design, engineering teams,
technical writing, oral presentation, and engineering ethics. The Software
Engineering sections do this specifically in the context of software
development. It's a very hands-on (and fun!) course, and we're looking forward
to the semester.

The first lab will be on Thursday, January 13 from 12:30 PM - 1:45 PM CT in
Shelby 2205. The first lecture will be on Friday, January 14 from 10:00 Am -
10:50 AM CT in Shelby 1103. Please refer to the course syllabus for details on
instructional modality, course policies, grading and more.

See you on Thursday, and War Eagle!
